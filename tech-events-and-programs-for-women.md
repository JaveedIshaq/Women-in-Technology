_Keep a lookout for these events every year! These links may be unavailable because the events keep getting updated every year or may have new names/websites. If so, a simple google search will yield updated results.  I request you to kindly update it here as well, if you find a new link. I am not completely removing any event however, since it may be renewed the next year, so it'll help if you give it a search. Let's all help the community grow!_
